### Work Experience

#### The University of Melbourne
- **AI Research Fellow** | Reporting to [Prof Lars Kulik](https://lars.kuliks.net/?page_id=6), Jan 2023 - Present  
  - Researcher for workstream 3 of the [MATCH project](https://www.musicattunedcare.com/).
  - Development of machine learning models to automate the detection of agitation symptoms related to dementia.
  - Built a data pipeline to extract and preprocess sensor-based physiological data from Empatica's EmbracePlus medical wearable.
  - Researched noise reduction techniques and integrated [DeepFilterNet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9914782) models into our data pipeline to remove/reduce noise from the collected audio data.
  - Developed an [Android/iOS app](https://github.com/stevcabello/CMAI-Labeller-App) for data collection of agitation symptoms in patients living with dementia.
  - Supervised the development of the MATCH app, which integrates the Spotify API to provide music recommendations.
  - Supervised an undergraduate project (SCIE30001 - 2023 SEMESTER 1) titled "Music Genre Classification with ResNet and Bi-GRU Using Visual Spectrograms".
  - Technical representative of the MATCH Safety and Capacity Building Committees.

#### RMIT University
- **Tutor** | Reporting to [Assoc Prof Andy Song](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/s/song-associate-professor-andy), Jul 2023 - Present  
  - Tutor, Lab Demonstrator, and Marker for Algorithms and Analysis (COSC2123 - 2023 Semester 2).
  - Explain key algorithmic design paradigms: brute force, divide and conquer, decrease and conquer, transform and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming and iterative improvement.
  - Explain key data structures: trees, lists, stacks, queues, hash tables and graph representations.
  - Theoretically compare and analyse the time complexities of algorithms and data structures.
 
#### RMIT University
- **Research Assistant** | Reported to [Dr Elham Naghizade](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/n/naghizade-dr-e), Nov 2022 - Apr 2023  
  - Developed [scripts](https://github.com/stevcabello/RMIT-ABC-Fact-Checked-Data-Collection) for web scraping ABC's Fact Check website in order to identify news with a potential tweet/twitter-related content.
  - Developed scripts to utilise the Twitter API for finding the source (i.e., original tweet) for each tweet extracted from ``The Claim" section on ABC's Fact Check website.
  - Developed scripts to utilise the Twitter API for generating cascades for particular tweets related to anti-feminist political discourse in Iran. Explored the ChatGPT API to automate the identification of sexism in tweets.
  - Delivered a talk titled ``ChatGPT as a scripting tool for researchers" for the CIDDA Human Information REtrieval (CHIRE) group at RMIT. I explained how to use ChatGPT for data preprocessing and data modelling purposes.
